# UDP-Raw-Packet-Sender
This repository contains a C program demonstrating a basic implementation of a UDP packet sender using raw sockets. The program crafts UDP packets with custom headers, sets up a raw socket, and sends the packets in a loop. The code is designed for educational purposes and serves as a simple example of low-level network programming in C.
